            Abres India was founded by Matin Ahmed Siddiqui in 1984, who drew inspiration from his father, Zahin Ahmed Siddiqui, a talented fashion designer known for his artistic and exquisite designs. Zahen Ahmed Siddiqui was a pioneer in the fashion design industry, and Matin took the lessons he learned from his father to establish a brand that combined tradition with innovation, setting the foundation for Abres India’s journey in the world of fashion.

          <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed">
            In the early years, Abres India focused primarily on printing fabrics. The first manufacturing plant was set up in Dharavi, Mumbai, which played a crucial role in launching the company's operations. With a vision to introduce creativity into fabric designs, Matin Ahmed Siddiqui and his team started experimenting with unique prints that revolutionized the fabric printing market. Our artistic designs quickly gained popularity, making us a trendsetter in the industry.

            Over time, Abres India expanded its product line to include a wide variety of clothing and accessories. We began producing belts, kurtis, jeans, formal shirts, fancy jackets, and coord sets. Our designs were not just stylish but also unique, reflecting our dedication to quality and creativity. The company's commitment to crafting high-quality, fashionable garments helped us earn a loyal customer base and a solid reputation in the market.

          <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed">
            As the company grew, we ventured into manufacturing on a larger scale, as well as textile trading. We focused on creating not only fashionable clothing but also supplying high-quality fabrics to other manufacturers and designers. This expansion allowed us to diversify our offerings, catering to both wholesale and retail markets. Today, we operate our wholesale business alongside our retail brand, Abres Essentials, which brings our stylish creations directly to consumers.

            The first website for Abres India was launched in 2005, marking our entry into the digital age. This website was a milestone in the company's history, allowing us to reach a broader audience and showcase our products to customers beyond geographical limitations. The website served as a platform for both information and sales, helping us establish an online presence that further enhanced our brand’s reach.

            In addition to our core focus on clothing, we also diversified into furniture manufacturing with our division, Abres Furniture. This expansion was driven by the same principles that guide our fashion business—creativity, quality, and a commitment to excellence. Our furniture designs are crafted with the same attention to detail that we put into our clothing, making them a unique addition to homes across the country.

We pride ourselves on offering something unique, pushing the boundaries of fashion, and taking it to a level unmatched by any other company.

Our Mumbai office serves as the hub of our creative and business operations, while our Prayagraj office helps us manage our extensive production and distribution network. Together, these offices help us maintain a strong connection with our customers and ensure the highest standards of quality in everything we produce.

We are proud of our heritage, excited about the future, and committed to pushing the boundaries of fashion with every new creation.

          <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed">
            Additionally, as part of our commitment to giving back to the community, Abres India has been involved in non-governmental organization work, such as feeding stray animals, for many years. We believe in making a positive difference, not only in the fashion industry but also in the world around us.
